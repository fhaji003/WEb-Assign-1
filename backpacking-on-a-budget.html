            <ul>
            <li>When traveling the most important step is to book your flight early. 
                The later you book your flight the more expensive <br/> it will be.</li>
                <li>Afer landing it is important to consider taking public transportation, even better is walking 
                to not only save money but <br/> also explore the city on your walk.</li>
                <li>When looking for places to stay, try to consider this on the same day you book your flight, 
                the sooner it is booked the <br/> cheaper, and also gives you plenty of time to look through the deals and find the best one
                that fits your budget. </li>
                <li>Try to eat at local market and street food stalls because this will not just save you money, 
                    but you will expereince the <br/> true life in that city. </li>
                <li>Try to find low cost activities, most cities have plenty of free or low cost activities that you can do
                    to help you explore <br/> the city more while being on a budget. </li>
                <li>Most importatnly pack all your essentials so that you're not buing them in a different currency.
                    You might often be <br/> tempted to buy suncreen when you arrive in that city becasue you don't want to pack it, but 
                    sunscreen in that city might <br/> cost you three times more than what you would have paid back home.</li>

            <li><strong>Clothing: </strong> Make sure you have enough clothes for the duration of your travel. 
            Pack lightweight, quick drying clothes that can be layered to make sure they can all fit in your suitcase.</li>
            <li><strong>Reusable Water Bottle: </strong>When you travel to a new city you will be out and exploring a lot so you need to make sure you are staying healthy and hydrated.</li>
