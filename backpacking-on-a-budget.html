        <p>As Arvin and I have both traveled to many places and have been in many 
        different situations while travelling. We thought we <br> should share some tips and tricks 
        on what we think could benefit a new traveler.

            <ul>
                <li>When traveling the most important step is to book your flight early. 
                The later you book your flight the more expensive <br> it will be.</li>
                <li>After landing it is important to consider taking public transportation, even better is walking 
                to not only save money but <br> also explore the city on your walk.</li>
                <li>When looking for places to stay, try to consider this on the same day you book your flight, 
                the sooner it is booked the <br> cheaper, and also gives you plenty of time to look through the deals and find the best one
                that fits your budget.</li>
                <li>Try to eat at local markets and street food stalls because this will not just save you money, 
                    but you will experience the <br> true life in that city.</li>
                <li>Try to find low-cost activities. Most cities have plenty of free or low-cost activities that you can do
                    to help you explore <br> the city more while being on a budget.</li>
                <li>Most importantly, pack all your essentials so that you're not buying them in a different currency.
                    You might often be <br> tempted to buy sunscreen when you arrive in that city because you don't want to pack it, but 
                    sunscreen in that city might <br> cost you three times more than what you would have paid back home.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backpack: </strong>Make sure you have a lightweight and comfortable backpack 
                that you can use to pack your stuff on your trips around the city.</li>
                <li><strong>Travel Documents: </strong> There is not much to say about this as you can't travel without them, and without these you will face many challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Clothing: </strong> Make sure you have enough clothes for the duration of your travel. 
                Pack lightweight, quick-drying clothes that can be layered to make sure they can all fit in your suitcase.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusable Water Bottle: </strong>When you travel to a new city you will be out and exploring a lot so you need to make sure you are staying healthy and hydrated.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Purpose Shoes: </strong> Make sure you have at least one pair of comfortable shoes that can be used for different activities.
                This will save a lot of space when packing for a trip and lower the weight you'll be carrying.</li>
