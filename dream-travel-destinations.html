                <p>Santorini is one of the most breathtaking places in the world.
                    We have both seen the famous whitewashed buildings <br/> overlooking the sea, and have always wanted to experience visiting them. 
                    Santorini, Greece is rich in history and culture with <br/> <strong>Fira & Oia</strong> being on our bucket list to walk through; 
                    experiencing charming street, local markets, and traditional Greek <br/> architecture.</p>

                <p>Tokyo is a city with ultramodern technology, and as our immaculate passion for technology,
                    we are very interested in visiting <br/> Japan, specifically Tokyo. The seasonal beauty Tokyo has is incomparabel with any other city. Tokyo changes dramatically <br/> with the seasons;
                    spring for breathtaking cherry blossoms, summer for lively festivals, autumn for stunning foliage, and <br/> winter for holiday illuminations</p>

                <p>Rome is a place where history, art, and culture blend seamlessly with modern life.
                    Rome is one of the most iconic travel <br/> destinations in the world
                    that offers breathtaking landmarks, rich traditions, and incredible food. 
                    Rome is more than just a <br/> historical city; Rome is a place where the past and present coexist
                    in a way that no other places can offer. The passion for <br/> Soccer runs deep in Rome, and a dream for any Soccer fan to visit.
                    As we are both big Soccer fans, and very interested in the <br/> history and food of Rome, 
                    we have put it on our bucket list to visit it and expereince life in Rome.

            <p>Cape Town is a melting pot culture and its cuisines and breathtaking activities is what stood out to us. 
                The beaches, food, and <br/> diversity is what we want to experience becasue Cape Town is an award-winning food and wine city. 
                The diversity makes it <br/> beautiful, and learning about different cultures and diverse groups is something that interests both of us as we both also come <br/> from different backgrounds. 
                We would be visiting Cape Town from November to March during the summer months to <br/> experience the beautiful beaches.

            <p>Madrid is the central capital of Spain known for its rich history, passionate soccer culture, and lively nightlife.
            <br/>Real Madrid is a soccer team in madrid that is the most succesfull in the world 
                 and we have always been their supporters ever <br/> since we were very young. 
                 As we are both in our early 20s, we want to experience the Madrid nightlife that everyone always <br/> talks about,
                 and the videos we have seen online have been very convincing. 
                 The food and culinary scenes in Madrid are immaculate, <br/> and we have both dreamed of trying the
                 traditional <strong>Tapas</strong> as it one of the richest and culturally the oldest.
