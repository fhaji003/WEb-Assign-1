                <p class="first-letter">Arvin and I are both first year Computer Information System's students. We both travel a lot and thought our website <br/> should evolve around that. 
                    We will talk about the places we want to visit in the future, 
                    how to backpack on a budget, <br/> as we are both university students and have a very tight budget,
                    and we will talk about special festivals around the <br/> world that we want to experience.
