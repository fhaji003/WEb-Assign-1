                    <p>Gion Matsuri is one of Japan's most famous festivals, 
                        held in Kyoto throughout July and centered around Yasaka Shrine. 
                        The highlights include the grand Yamaboko Processions on July 17 and 24, 
                        where massive, beautifully decorated floats parade through the streets. 
                        Leading up to these parades, the **Yoiyama Evenings** offer a lively 
                        atmosphere with food stalls, performances, and illuminated floats. 
                        Originally a purification ritual to ward off epidemics, 
                        the festival remains deeply rooted in tradition while attracting visitors from all over the world.
